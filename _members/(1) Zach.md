I am a researcher studying intelligence, both algorithmic and physical. My expertise is in robotics, control theory, and dynamical systems. In particular, much of my ongoing research focuses on the incorporation of physical and algorithmic compliance into robots, with the goal of producing systems that can more naturally, gracefully, and safely interact with the world around them.

I am an incoming professor at Case Western Reserve University (starting Jan 2025) in the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with an affiliation in the Human Fusions Institute. There, I am starting the Cybernetics and Physical Intelligence Lab (CyPhi Lab). Currently, I finishing a postdoc at MITâ€™s CSAIL. I got my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at CMU and my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at Pitt. My research has been covered in the popular press by outlets such as the BBC, Scientific American, and Mashable.
