# **EMAE 485: Nonlinear Dynamics and Control**


## Course Description
This course will teach students how to analyze and apply control algorithms for nonlinear systems based on modern best practices. While the course by necessity deals with highly theoretical concepts, these will be approached and developed in the context of relevant issues in application areas of interest, with a particular focus on robotics. Specific goals include (1) introduction to nonlinear dynamics analysis, (2) understanding of mathematical certification for control systems, (3) presentation of modern nonlinear control algorithms and their properties, and (4) applications of the preceding topics to practical problems in robotics and other areas through assignments and exams.

## Grading

| Weight      | Deliverable |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 40%      | Homework |
| 20%   | Mid Term Exam |
| 40%   | Final Project |

## Project
The goal of the class project is to get students to apply concepts from the course on a specific application of their choice. Students may work as individuals or in small groups, but the project is expected to scale with the size of the group. If students have ongoing research, they are welcome to work on that topic as long as the class component of the project is clearly utilizing concepts from the class. Otherwise, students are encouraged to be creative and will be provided with a list of potential ideas. Deliverables for the project will include a brief proposal to initiate the project, several check-ins with the instructor, the primary deliverable, a class paper written in IEEE conference format, and a brief presentation of the results to the class. 

## Policies
**Late Assignment Policy:** Students are allowed a budget of 6 late days for turning in homework with no penalty throughout the semester. They may be used together on one assignment, or separately on multiple assignments. Beyond these six days, no other late homework will be accepted. 

**AI Policy:** Students are allowed to use large language models (e.g. ChatGPT) to complete assignments, especially for coding exercises. However, AI (along with any other computing technology), is expressly forbidden during exams. Additionally, even during assignments, students should be cautious of using AI for this course material - I have observed that lazy usage without verification will in practice result in bad results and a bad grade. 

**Academic Integrity Policy:** Students are strongly encouraged to collaborate on assignments. All students in this course are expected to adhere to University standards of academic integrity.  Cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation, use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) without instructor permission, and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.  This includes, but is not limited to, consulting with another person during an exam, turning in written work that was prepared by someone other than you, making minor modifications to the work of someone else and turning it in as your own, or engaging in misrepresentation in seeking a postponement or extension.  Ignorance will not be accepted as an excuse.  If you are not sure whether something you plan to submit would be considered either cheating or plagiarism, it is your responsibility to ask for clarification. 

**Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:** In accordance with federal law, if you have a documented disability, you may be eligible to request accommodations from Disability Resources.  In order to be considered for accommodations you must present an accommodation letter from Disability Resources.  An appointment can be made by visiting Disability Resources in Sears 402, calling the office at 216-368-5230, or by emailing the office at disability@case.edu.  To get more information on how to begin the process, see: https://students.case.edu/academic/disability/getstarted/. 

Please keep in mind that accommodations are not retroactive.
